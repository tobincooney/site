		<p>
			I've always liked paying attention to the way physical spaces feel, and for a while now I've been realizing just how much my perception of a space is dictated by lighting. The same room in the day and the night feels completely different. One of the ways this shows up in my life is that certain lightings in my house will make my brain switch between Summer- and Winter-Mode&trade;. The idea for this photo series was to capture the idea of winter light&#8212;or more specifically (since a good portion of my winter memories are in electrical light at night) winter sunlight. A lot of the images are looking at the morning sunlight off some plants and snow outside. #5 in particular I liked for the way it caught the bright open morning feeling in January. There was also one photo from a cloudy day (which is one subset of the winter light idea which, to be perfectly honest, I really didn't feel like capturing that much more of), and a few photos of the way the afternoon sunlight looks inside (given the way my house is aligned, this is the time of year when we get the most sunlight through the windows in the afternoon), especially reflecting off the orange-leaning wall color in a lot of our house.
			<br /><br />
			I edited all of these photos to remove some of the white glare that my camera always picks up, and did a bit of extra color grading to a few while I was at it. A couple of the images are in black and white, since I felt like that sort of conveyed the different details of the scene better (particularly with image #3, I wanted to take emphasis off of the color and look more at the texture of the snow in the light/shadow), and with all of them I decided to put a little black border around them, which I think looks pretty nice. Images #1 and #10 especially get a new context from that sort of framing: in #1 it makes the colors more pronounced (also sort of does this in #5, I think), and in #10 it sort of gives it a widescreen movie frame feeling. In images #5 and #9 I actually added that bit of white camera glare back in, to brighten the whole thing and make it so you feel the light around the edges of the scene a bit more, reflecting outside of just the frame of the photo.
