		<p>The idea of this piece was to contrast a fantastical scene with a mundane but still detailed one. I set it up as a middleground seen through a window, separated from a small scene inside. Outside is a sort of rambling house structure (inspired partially by the Spirited Away bathhouse), taking up a lot of the middleground and creating a little nest around the foreground. On the other side of the window is a small scene of a table, with a spiral notebook and a mug, both fairly modern and plain-looking by comparison. These two scenes next to each other aren't meant to necessarily look out of place with one another (the color palette is pretty much consistent between the two), but it does show a sort of separation between a made-up space and a realistic one. To some extent this was meant to show a fantastical landscape in the context of daily life, and there's an element of familiarity and comfort to it. In terms of execution, the sort of roughness to the texture and colors added to the tone of the whole piece, but it could have been interesting to experiment with separating the color palettes between the foreground, middleground, and background to emphasize that contrast. There were a number of sketches for possible composition/perspective in this piece, and while the final one worked out about how I imagined, there were others that created a different space that I still might try.</p>
