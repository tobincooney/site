			<h4>On black and white experiments</h4>
			The thing that stands out to me the most about black and white is the way it emphasizes texture. I tried taking a whole bunch of different kinds of photos and seeing how they looked in black and white: these are photos from November when I walked around Cranbrook Gardens with family. I brought images into Photoshop, turned off the saturation, then messed with the light levels and exposure. With a few of them I started off by editing the images in color so that the color level changes would carry over to black and white.
			<br /><br />
			I went back through a whole bunch of old pictures I've taken and tried converting them to black and white. If I edit the photo in monochrome before I see it in color, it makes me look at it totally differently. Seeing photos together looks more cohesive&#8212;there's more unity to each photo, and it's also easier to give it balance since everything is made of different values of the same color. I really like black and white for capturing a scene, and I think I'm definitely going to do a whole bunch more of this. There were a couple instances where a photo felt like it was more about an effect&#8212;an impression, sort of&#8212;and the monochrome didn't capture that the same way color did, but it does give more of a sense of a single moment being captured (maybe just because I associate color photos with every-day things, pictures taken on a phone, etc.).
