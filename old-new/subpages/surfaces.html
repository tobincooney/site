		<h3><a href="../index.html" >Portfolio</a> / <a href="../photo.html" >Photography</a> / Surfaces (microscope) series</h3>
		<p>
			For this series I picked a couple of surfaces to look at through a microscope&#8212;both more obviously intricate things like a few different leaves and a bit of moss, and some plastic and paper objects which look more consistent at a distance. For the images of leaves I lit them so you can make out the individual cells, and I also looked at some of the fibers of paper and printed and written words. All 10 images are shot through the lens of the microscope, giving them a circular frame which both ties the images together and gives some additional context, making it a bit more clear that these are close-up shots.
			<br /><br />
			This series was centered around the idea that surfaces which look uniform at a distance actually have a lot of texture and detail when looked at more closely. At that scale, there's a sense of space when looking at even the flattest and simplest surfaces. It becomes clear that you're not looking at something uniform, and instead it actually feels like you're moving around in a tiny physical space with depth. A big factor in composing these images was trying to capture that tiny texture and depth that I was seeing when looking through the microscope: a few images are framed from straight above, showing more directly the texture and detail on an otherwise flat surface (the shots of the leaves, for example, were angled straight down, but still the result reminded me of something like a map, with the veins of the leaf looking a bit like rivers), but others&#8212;like the images of microcassette tape spools&#8212;are more more focused on the depth of the small spaces, with the thin field of focus and the angle of the light highlighting that feeling of distance, making it look much bigger than it is.
