			Some photos outside from while/after it was raining on Thursday or whatever day that was--<br /><br />
			I love the way all the dark colors get darker + all the greens get brighter when it rains, and the way water on imperfect surfaces ends up making all kinds of little facets. I took a couple photos of raindrops hitting the ground, and a few closeups of some plants with raindrops. I edited them all using Photoshop, playing with levels/curves/saturation, and I gave them all a border since the images had all been slightly different sizes. I'm not sure the border looks quite right. It works on most of the 2:3-ish images, but on the wide image of the raindrop it might've been better to give it no border on the left or right. My phone camera also doesn't do a great job of focusing close up, so a couple of the images look fuzzier than I'd like. I think for the two raindrop images it would have been nice to be able to adjust the shutter speed and catch it a bit faster/clearer than what I got.
