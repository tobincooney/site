			The idea behind this piece was to copy the motion in the frames of a video in small watercolor sketches, compile them into an animation, and set them to music. The initial video was timed to a metronome to line the final copy up. The final video is 8fps, 216 frames in total, with some color-correction. Much of the animation is centered around the effects and music, but there's some focus on orbital patterns. Ultimately the frantic energy of the song matches the skipping of the frames, the imperfect alignment and color-correction.

			Some notes on what I'd change:
			<br /><br />
    		The medium of watercolor doesn't come close to demonstrating the kind of scale I was imagining, and as a result the idea of power isn't really conveyed apart from that frantic feeling that ended up coming from the video and music together. Animation is apparently an even longer and more difficult process than I expected. The song has vaguely the right shape and tune I was going for, but the textures are all wrong. A lower frame rate and a more opaque medium would be better for this project. Song should be slower, calmer. Starting from video before making song could help with a sense of story, pacing. Start as animatic, build around, then make frames.
