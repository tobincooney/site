		<h3>Portfolio / Music</h3>

			Since April 2020 I've been releasing what I've been calling a "Notebook Album" each month, full of random musical experiments. Between this and other projects, I've been writing on piano, a tiny bit of cello, and I've written a number of scores for instruments I have no clue how to play, which are mainly in here as MIDI playback using MuseScore.

			<h4>Snowfall (some wintry tunes to cook some food to)</h4>

				<i>"I'm very interested in the idea of a piece of music being a place to think."   &#8212;Max Richter</i>
				<br /><br />
				Food is something that has always lived at the edge of my life. I have memories of food, I have likes and dislikes, but I rarely take a second to look at it. Music is one of only a couple media that take place over a set amount of time, and I wanted to use that to give myself time and reason&#8212;an excuse, almost&#8212;to just give attention to food for a while. Recently for the first time I saw a model of a healthy meal laid out simply as &frac14; grains, &frac14; proteins, and &frac12; fruits and vegetables. That image captured and reminded me of what I find exciting about food: thinking of it as something that's elemental, with simple components that make something cohesive.
				<br /><br />
				When I started writing this piece, I was looking back at where food fit in with my life. A lot of my memories of food are largely about atmosphere. There's the bright cold liveliness of brunch, and the warmth of dinner after sunset against snow outside. Memories of winter and food are always tangled together in my mind. I started playing with a few themes that held that slow warmth, and a few that were cold, and a few that were bright. In the end the piece had four themes: a chime-like pattering progression with some sense of gathering, leading into a heavy and cold theme for snowfall, then a calm warm section that feels safe and like a story, then finally a bright and soft morning tune, and the piece closes with a repetition of the cold snowfall, fading out in slow crashing echoes. The feeling of winter runs throughout the whole thing. That sense of warmth against the cold outside sort of embodies what I romanticize about food, and this piece is just a few minutes to walk through that atmosphere.

			<h4>UNLATCH</h4>
			<p class="date">October 2020</p>
			<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3842070081/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2125800741/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/album/notebook-vii-october-2020">Notebook VII: October 2020 by Tobin Cooney</a></iframe>
			<p class="post-content">
				<a href="./portfolio/music/UNLATCH sketch.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PDF of score sketch</b></a> <br /><br />
				The piece begins with a single unchanging note&#8212;a B&#9838;, falling on a 5th in the song's initial key of E minor. Softly the song starts to wake up around it, with several instruments picking up melodies in harmony with it. The song progresses this way, with the held note fading into the background, until the flow of the other instruments carries the song into F&#x266F; major. Now the held note&#8212;though it hasn't changed since the start of the song&#8212;falls on a stubborn 4th in the new scale, and as the note resurfaces in the mix, it quickly becomes apparent that it now creates a harsh dissonance with the chords in the second half of the piece. After a few measures of growing clashing noise, everything briefly cuts out. Softly the bass instruments return, and soon the original sample returns as well, this time following a melody that fits right in within F&#x266F; major. After this, some of the melody from the clashing section fades back in, now welcome in this new context.
				Though the held note didn't shift during the key change, it is clear that the note did become dissonant when the chords around it changed. The combination of textures during the dissonant portion, though all individually inoffensive, become harsh in combination, until eventually the song is cut apart, and phrases are allowed to fade in and out independently, the rigidity of the held B&#9838; now broken.
				<br />
				<br />
				Having this sketch gave me something to keep drawing the piece back in toward. The song fits the structure I intended pretty well, but that structure is minimal, so around it there's no real rhyme or reason to the melodies I ended up writing. Still, even if nobody hears this and thinks, "why of course, the sustained B&#9838; of societal norms, slowly coming into conflict with a changing world around them," having that structure did give the piece a clear direction to go in, and in the end, if nothing else, it sounds pretty alright.
