Between this and other projects, I've been writing on piano, a tiny bit of cello, and I've written a number of scores for instruments I have no clue how to play, which are mainly in here as MIDI playback using MuseScore.</p></div></a>

Here are some of the more interesting things I've captured.</p></div></a><br />
