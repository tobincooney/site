				<h3>Hello, I am a human who has created some things&#8212;</h3><br /><br />
				<p id="description">
					I make music in various forms, am slowly learning about photography, and occasionally will experiment with things like painting and animation. A lot of the pieces I've made focus on a sense of space, whether that's more literal in the composition of a visual piece, or more about an impression, as with music. Here you'll find a selection of various thoughts and creations of mine.<br />

Between this and other projects, I've been writing on piano, a tiny bit of cello, and I've written a number of scores for instruments I have no clue how to play, which are mainly in here as MIDI playback using MuseScore.</p></div></a>

Here are some of the more interesting things I've captured.</p></div></a><br />
