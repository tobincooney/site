					<p>Some photos outside from while/after it was raining on Thursday or whatever day that was--</p>
					<p>I love the way all the dark colors get darker + all the greens get brighter when it rains, and the way water on imperfect surfaces ends up making all kinds of little facets. I took a couple photos of raindrops hitting the ground, and a few closeups of some plants with raindrops. I edited them all using Photoshop, playing with levels/curves/saturation, and I gave them all a border since the images had all been slightly different sizes. I'm not sure the border looks quite right. It works on most of the 2:3-ish images, but on the wide image of the raindrop it might've been better to give it no border on the left or right. My phone camera also doesn't do a great job of focusing close up, so a couple of the images look fuzzier than I'd like. I think for the two raindrop images it would have been nice to be able to adjust the shutter speed and catch it a bit faster/clearer than what I got.</p>

				<p>newly-selected portfolio</p>
				<p>this class was my first attempt at any kind of photography-ing.</p>

				<div class="project" style="border-color:blue;">
				<p><strong>cranbrook & kensington</strong> (description i turned in w/ the assignment)<strong>:</strong></p>
				<p>The thing that stands out to me the most about black and white is the way it emphasizes texture. I tried taking a whole bunch of different kinds of photos and seeing how they looked in black and white: these are photos from November when I walked around Cranbrook Gardens with family. I brought images into Photoshop, turned off the saturation, then messed with the light levels and exposure. With a few of them I started off by editing the images in color so that the color level changes would carry over to black and white.</p>
				<p>I went back through a whole bunch of old pictures I've taken and tried converting them to black and white. If I edit the photo in monochrome before I see it in color, it makes me look at it totally differently. Seeing photos together looks more cohesive&#8212;there's more unity to each photo, and it's also easier to give it balance since everything is made of different values of the same color. I really like black and white for capturing a scene, and I think I'm definitely going to do a whole bunch more of this. There were a couple instances where a photo felt like it was more about an effect&#8212;an impression, sort of&#8212;and the monochrome didn't capture that the same way color did, but it does give more of a sense of a single moment being captured (maybe just because I associate color photos with every-day things, pictures taken on a phone, etc.).</p>

				<p>winter sunlight</p>
				<p>I've always liked paying attention to the way physical spaces feel, and for a while now I've been realizing just how much my perception of a space is dictated by lighting. The same room in the day and the night feels completely different. One of the ways this shows up in my life is that certain lightings in my house will make my brain switch between Summer- and Winter-Mode&trade;. The idea for this photo series was to capture the idea of winter light&#8212;or more specifically (since a good portion of my winter memories are in electrical light at night) winter sunlight. A lot of the images are looking at the morning sunlight off some plants and snow outside. #5 in particular I liked for the way it caught the bright open morning feeling in January. There was also one photo from a cloudy day (which is one subset of the winter light idea which, to be perfectly honest, I really didn't feel like capturing that much more of), and a few photos of the way the afternoon sunlight looks inside (given the way my house is aligned, this is the time of year when we get the most sunlight through the windows in the afternoon), especially reflecting off the orange-leaning wall color in a lot of our house.</p>
			<p>I edited all of these photos to remove some of the white glare that my camera always picks up, and did a bit of extra color grading to a few while I was at it. A couple of the images are in black and white, since I felt like that sort of conveyed the different details of the scene better (particularly with image #3, I wanted to take emphasis off of the color and look more at the texture of the snow in the light/shadow), and with all of them I decided to put a little black border around them, which I think looks pretty nice. Images #1 and #10 especially get a new context from that sort of framing: in #1 it makes the colors more pronounced (also sort of does this in #5, I think), and in #10 it sort of gives it a widescreen movie frame feeling. In images #5 and #9 I actually added that bit of white camera glare back in, to brighten the whole thing and make it so you feel the light around the edges of the scene a bit more, reflecting outside of just the frame of the photo.</p>

				<p>in a block with individual projects under it</p>
				<p>from the digital school year, some projects i made:</p>

					<li class="list">question everything: <code>UNLATCH</code></li>
					<li class="list">nature: <code>Surfaces (microscope) series</code>
						<div class="project" style="border-color:blue;">
							<p>For this series I picked a couple of surfaces to look at through a microscope&#8212;both more obviously intricate things like a few different leaves and a bit of moss, and some plastic and paper objects which look more consistent at a distance. For the images of leaves I lit them so you can make out the individual cells, and I also looked at some of the fibers of paper and printed and written words. All 10 images are shot through the lens of the microscope, giving them a circular frame which both ties the images together and gives some additional context, making it a bit more clear that these are close-up shots.</p>
							<p>This series was centered around the idea that surfaces which look uniform at a distance actually have a lot of texture and detail when looked at more closely. At that scale, there's a sense of space when looking at even the flattest and simplest surfaces. It becomes clear that you're not looking at something uniform, and instead it actually feels like you're moving around in a tiny physical space with depth. A big factor in composing these images was trying to capture that tiny texture and depth that I was seeing when looking through the microscope: a few images are framed from straight above, showing more directly the texture and detail on an otherwise flat surface (the shots of the leaves, for example, were angled straight down, but still the result reminded me of something like a map, with the veins of the leaf looking a bit like rivers), but others&#8212;like the images of microcassette tape spools&#8212;are more more focused on the depth of the small spaces, with the thin field of focus and the angle of the light highlighting that feeling of distance, making it look much bigger than it is.</p>

					<li class="list">power: <code>DUST+AND+STATIC.mp4</code>
						<div class="project" style="border-color:blue;"> <p>The idea behind this piece was to copy the motion in the frames of a video in small watercolor sketches, compile them into an animation, and set them to music. The initial video was timed to a metronome to line the final copy up. The final video is 8fps, 216 frames in total, with some color-correction. Much of the animation is centered around the effects and music, but there's some focus on orbital patterns. Ultimately the frantic energy of the song matches the skipping of the frames, the imperfect alignment and color-correction.</p>
							<p>Some notes on what I'd change:</p>
							<p>The medium of watercolor doesn't come close to demonstrating the kind of scale I was imagining, and as a result the idea of power isn't really conveyed apart from that frantic feeling that ended up coming from the video and music together. Animation is apparently an even longer and more difficult process than I expected. The song has vaguely the right shape and tune I was going for, but the textures are all wrong. A lower frame rate and a more opaque medium would be better for this project. Song should be slower, calmer. Starting from video before making song could help with a sense of story, pacing. Start as animatic, build around, then make frames.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="list">fantasy: <code>Walls and Waves 1</code>
						<div class="project" style="border-color:blue;">
							<p>The idea of this piece was to contrast a fantastical scene with a mundane but still detailed one. I set it up as a middleground seen through a window, separated from a small scene inside. Outside is a sort of rambling house structure (inspired partially by the Spirited Away bathhouse), taking up a lot of the middleground and creating a little nest around the foreground. On the other side of the window is a small scene of a table, with a spiral notebook and a mug, both fairly modern and plain-looking by comparison. These two scenes next to each other aren't meant to necessarily look out of place with one another (the color palette is pretty much consistent between the two), but it does show a sort of separation between a made-up space and a realistic one. To some extent this was meant to show a fantastical landscape in the context of daily life, and there's an element of familiarity and comfort to it. In terms of execution, the sort of roughness to the texture and colors added to the tone of the whole piece, but it could have been interesting to experiment with separating the color palettes between the foreground, middleground, and background to emphasize that contrast. There were a number of sketches for possible composition/perspective in this piece, and while the final one worked out about how I imagined, there were others that created a different space that I still might try.</p>

				<p>this was sort of my first attempt at writing orchestral music that had some sort of distinct theme. I wrote it for <a href="#adv-port-1">Advanced Art Portfolio 1</a> just around the start of covid. you can listen to it on <a href="https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/album/starling-and-kingfisher">Bandcamp</a> as well.</p>

				<p>this class was the first time i really thought about art and how i might want to make it. I wasn't working on music at all in this context yet, and toward the end of the class i started experimenting with sculpture projects with more of a sort of story to them.</p>
				<p>my last project for this class, which i never got a chance to finish properly, was all about time and growth and erosion: I cast a face in biodegradable plastic (which i tried to make at home, with little success) and planned to fill the sculpture with soil and plant mushrooms in it, and then take a photo of it from the same place at regular intervals thruogh the seasons until they started to grow. the whole thing ended up being rushed and falling apart several times, and i never set it up in its final place, but i kinda want to do something with this idea again.</p>
