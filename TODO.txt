TODO
[ ] sort through all the media/ files
[ ] compile music & photography condensed portfolio pages
	[ ] album cover
	[ ] remaster
[\] put in descriptions for all the projects in archive
[ ] turn bandcamp albums into local files (or just backup)
[ ] thumbnail images for photography
[ ] better photo of painting?
[ ] photos of some sketches? maybe have that be a yearly entry too? just like "hey here's stome stuff"
[X] take good photo of still life
[ ] upload all the media to hwc or wherever else
[ ] replace thumbnails with much smaller thumbnails
[ ] finish & upload adv. port. 2 proj. no. 4
[ ] artist's statements, as well as individual proj/ html pages for each project (or subproject, in the case of some classes. or both? like an 'adv. port. 2 class' page and then subpages for like 'postmodern proj. 1: toad'?)
[ ] * more visuals
	- words are very dense. try to make it more intuitive if you can
[ ] replace flex with tables (at least in some places) (branch 'table')
[ ] SVG designs?
[ ] i think it would be good to find a way to store this as markdown, and write a little compiler to wrap it up into html


i think generally the vibe is rewriting everything as i remember it, so like don't just copy and paste in the old artist's statments, instead actually give context, so it all feels liks it goes together as one thing.
