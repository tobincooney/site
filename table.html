				Every month since April 2020 I've released what I'm calling a "notebook album" of musical things I did in that month. You can see all of those on <a href="https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, and I'm also compiling some of the better snippets <a href="music.html">here</a>.

				<p>Over the last few months I've been learning about photography and composition and experimenting with digital editing and film photography/the darkroom process. <a href="photo.html">Here</a> are some selected good bits from those experiments. (More in the <a href="archive/index.html">archive</a>.)</p>
