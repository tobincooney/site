- top of the page: links to [[portfolio album]] in case you missed it, but then:
- __by year__
- [ ] table of contents
- each year has writing (overview) & subheaders for projects, links to where the media are.
- i'll probably link to music & stuff here, NOT the whole archive of portfolio albums
- __TAGGED BY GRADE!__
