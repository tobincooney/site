- top of the page: links to [[portfolio album]] in case you missed it (it doesn't show up in the archive timeline, it's just the curation), but then:
- __by year__
- [ ] table of contents
- each year has writing (overview) & subheaders for projects, links to where the media are.
- i'll probably link to music & stuff here, NOT the whole archive of portfolio albums
- __TAGGED BY GRADE!__
- [ ] look thru. mscz files??
	- garage band files??
- __note__: include original music files, like the wav files themselves, on the hwc server probably
- below the table of contents: show tags (music, gourdboat, 10th grade, however you want to categorize them). when you click it, give an index of all the things with that tag, just layed out.... it would be nice if you could do it like a filter. like a javascript thing: don't write the elements that don't have ```class="tag-music"``` sort of thing... i don't know
