# pinned section

home page; some context and then links to the portfolio parts with bits of context for each of them too (see old original site). don't worry about formatting until all the content is there!




Who am I?
excellent question

a couple things pinned
notes about what i'm actually working on: ongoing projects & things
* explain notebook albums ('sketchbooks') & __link__ to full database [bandcamp](https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/)
	* this is the page where the talking all is. So give all the context here for all the sea of confusing stuff that exists on the other pages.
* [gourdboat](obsidian://open?vault=gourdboat&file=README)? ([site](https://gourdboat.github.io/))
* [ ] [[portfolio album]]

- music selection [[portfolio album]]
- photography selection
- any other fun pieces i want to highlight (don't worry too much about catagories. The selections are just to make it less overwhelming. This is just __stuff you don't want people to miss.__)
	- toad!
- then link : view full [[archive]]


* but it could be nice to have it be like a gallery, not comprehensive & covering everything I've done but just sort of a good selection that you can browse around.
