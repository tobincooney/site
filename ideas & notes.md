### initial brainstorm

- hosting
	- https://fredcashoon.github.io/
	- https://heartwoodcollective.com/TobinCooney
	- https://tobincooney.com/ ?


- easy way to navigate portfolio
	- [ ] make thumbnail images for photography
	- good *hierarchy*!
		- don't do photos as series
		- by medium or by intent? Or how about just by date?
			- by year
		- __searchable?__
		- table of contents like wikipedia?
	
	
- better music selection
	- [ ] [[portfolio album]] 
		- embed bandcamp stuff
		- https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/album/the-good-things-comp-draft (will make it public when it's good)
	- explain notebook albums ('sketchbooks') & link to full database
	- also include good bits from sketchbook that aren't polished


	
- [ ] take better photo of painting
- [ ] some photos of physical actual sketches? That would be fun
-  notes about what I'm actually working on! *
	- [gourdboat](obsidian://open?vault=gourdboat&file=README)?
- [ ] good still life photo






__OTHER PROJECTS!__
- bookmaking & stuff
	- we've got the identity thing from last year open studio if you want
	- other experiments and fun little things


## style
- dark theme adaptation
- basic sans-serif font
- very minimal.
	- maybe copy gourdboat template, but make it look a bit less cheap
