### initial brainstorm


- easy way to navigate portfolio
	- [ ] make thumbnail images for photography
	- good *hierarchy*!
		- don't do photos as series
		- by medium or by intent? Or how about just by date?
			- by year
		- __searchable?__
		- table of contents like wikipedia?
	
	
- better music selection
	- [ ] [[compile portfolio album]] 
		- embed:: private bandcamp album?
		<iframe src="https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/album/the-good-things-comp-draft"></iframe><br />
		- https://tobincooney.bandcamp.com/album/the-good-things-comp-draft
		-  Don't know how to share this though.
	- explain notebook albums ('sketchbooks') & link to full database
	- also include good bits from sketchbook that aren't polished


	
- [ ] take better photo of painting
- [ ] some photos of physical actual sketches? That would be fun
- __*__ notes about what I'm actually working on!
	- [[gourdboat]]?
- [ ] good still life photo






__OTHER PROJECTS!__
- bookmaking & stuff
	- we've got the identity thing from last year open studio if you want
	- other experiments and fun little things


## style
- dark theme adaptation
- basic sans-serif font
- very minimal.
	- maybe copy gourdboat template, but make it look a bit less cheap
